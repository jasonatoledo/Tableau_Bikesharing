## Overview

The purpose of this analysis in Tableau was to take raw data from the NYC Citi Bike site and transform it into a series of data visualizations to understand the breakdown of the days of the week and users who use the service. I was tasked with converting the tripduration column from an integer value to a datetime value using Python via Jupyter Notebook then using the file for the analysis. Once the visualizations were built, I put them together into a comprehensive story in Tableau.
